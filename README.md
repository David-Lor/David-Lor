These are some of the main ideas I'm/I've been working on:

### üí´Main project

[VigoBus-TelegramBot](https://github.com/David-Lor/VigoBus-TelegramBot): A Telegram Bot to check the buses by stops on my hometown.
Split into 3 services ([bot backend](https://github.com/David-Lor/VigoBus-TelegramBot), [bus+stops API](https://github.com/David-Lor/Python_VigoBusAPI), [persistence API](https://github.com/David-Lor/Telegram-BusBot-DataManager)),
could be easily ported to other cities or even other public transport systems that work on a similar manner.
Deployed at [@vigobusbot](https://telegram.me/vigobusbot) (stable) and [@vigobustestbot](https://telegram.me/vigobustestbot) (development).
