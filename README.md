These are some of the main ideas I'm/I've been working on:

### üí´Main project

[VigoBus-TelegramBot](https://github.com/David-Lor/VigoBus-TelegramBot): A Telegram Bot to check the buses by stops on my hometown.
Split into 3 services ([bot backend](https://github.com/David-Lor/VigoBus-TelegramBot), [bus+stops API](https://github.com/David-Lor/Python_VigoBusAPI), [persistence API](https://github.com/David-Lor/Telegram-BusBot-DataManager)),
could be easily ported to other cities or even other public transport systems that work on a similar manner. 
Deployed at [@vigobusbot](https://telegram.me/vigobusbot) (stable) and [@vigobustestbot](https://telegram.me/vigobustestbot) (development).

### ‚öôÔ∏èLibraries

- [python-wait4it](https://github.com/David-Lor/python-wait4it): wait for a TCP port to be reachable, or a function to pass without exceptions.
- [ThisPersonDoesNotExistAPI](https://github.com/David-Lor/ThisPersonDoesNotExistAPI): Python interface to acquire pictures from thispersondoesnotexist.com.

### üîÄNode-RED Nodes

- [public-ip-address](https://github.com/David-Lor/node-red-contrib-public-ip-address): get the current public IP address.
- [duckdns](https://github.com/David-Lor/node-red-contrib-duckdns): update DDNS domains on DuckDNS.

### üê≥Docker images

- [Python-Git-App](https://github.com/David-Lor/Docker-Python-Git-App): image for deploying generic Python apps, that clones a repository and pip installs requirements when the container starts for the first time (from [deprecated project](https://github.com/David-Lor/Docker-Python-Autoclonable-App)).
- [SSH-PortForward-Client](https://github.com/David-Lor/Docker-SSH-Port-Forward-Client): dockerized SSH client for SSH Port Forwarding.
- [SSH-PortForward-Server](https://github.com/David-Lor/Docker-SSH-Port-Forward-Server): dockerized SSH server for SSH Port Forwarding.


### üß™Proof of Concepts

- [Telegram Bot Updates Receiver Service](https://github.com/David-Lor/TelegramBot-Webhook-Updates-Receiver-Service): microservice-based that receives Telegram Bot updates via Webhook, and publishes them on a queue or message broker.
- [pytelegrambotapi + Redis queue](https://github.com/David-Lor/pytelegrambotapi-redisqueue_POC): microservice-based Telegram Bot that uses a Redis queue to enqueue client updates, and process them with multiple workers.
- [Logging Requests](https://github.com/David-Lor/Logging-Requests-POC): API that traces log records per-requests, using Loguru + context variables, to store the records grouped by each individual request.
- [ZeroHealthCheck](https://github.com/David-Lor/ZeroHealthCheck): decentralized service that healthchecks other nodes, using ZeroMQ.
- [pydantic-etcd](https://github.com/David-Lor/pydantic-etcd): modified Pydantic BaseSettings class that supports loading variables from ETCD.
- [InventoryAPI](https://github.com/David-Lor/Arango-Foxx-Inventory-API): REST API to store generic items hierarchically or container-based, using ArangoDB and built as an Arango's Foxx service.

### üó£Talks & sample projects

- [FastAPI+Pydantic+Mongo API (sample)](https://github.com/David-Lor/FastAPI-Pydantic-Mongo_Sample_CRUD_API): REST API with CRUD operations, built in Python with FastAPI, Pydantic and MongoDB.
- [pytest (examples)](https://github.com/David-Lor/pytest-talk-examples): introduction to pyTest and some of its capabilities, through examples.
- [FastAPI (lightning talk)](https://github.com/David-Lor/FastAPI_LightningTalk-Notebook): introduction to FastAPI.

### üöòGTA5/üêéRDR2 Scripts

- [GTAV-SimpleGangWar](https://github.com/David-Lor/GTAV-SimpleGangWar): simple battle creator between two teams (allies and enemies) that fight each other on a frontal clash. Intended to have a nice balance between simplicity and high customization.
- [RDR2-SimpleGangWar](https://github.com/David-Lor/RDR2-SimpleGangWar): simple battle creator between two teams (allies and enemies) that fight each other on a frontal clash. Intended to have a nice balance between simplicity and high customization.
- [GTAV-LocationalDamage](https://github.com/David-Lor/LocationalDamage): implementation of a realistic damage system that reduces armor or health based on where the damage is dealt (torso or other parts).
- [GTAV-SelectiveFire](https://github.com/David-Lor/SelectiveFire): implementation of a selective fire mode for automatic guns (semi-auto and burst fire, plus full-auto).
- [GTAV-AccuracyFix](https://github.com/David-Lor/AccuracyFix): override of accuracy levels for all peds, with multiple settings.

### üß∏Scripts & others
